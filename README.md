# COVID-19-Diagnosis-Prediction-
Machine Learning Project for diagnosis of COVID -19
Introduction:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.
COVID-19 Diagnosis Prediction Project

---
Goal: The assignment aims to predict COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms and demographic data, utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques.
How: We use Python and MySQL for data analysis, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning to predict COVID-19 outcomes.
Why: Our project is crucial for early COVID-19 detection, efficient healthcare resource allocation, and informed public health decisions, improving overall wellbeing

Q1 . Why is your proposal important in todayâ€™s world? How predicting a disease accurately can improve medical treatment?

ANS :

Predicting diseases accurately using machine learning, particularly for COVID-19, holds significant importance in today's world as early detection of such diseases on the basis of symptoms can help the healthcare facility to isolate and treat the patient timely, this is crucial to prevent the spread of disease.

Q2. How is it going to impact the medical field when it comes to effective screening and reducing health care burden.

ANS:

Our Medical facilities are using tests such as RAT(Rapid Antigen Test) to detect whether a person is covid affected, while our ML model uses patient's data to detect whether a particular patient is covid affected or not with atmost accuracy, this will help to reduce the burden of testing and screening on health care fascilities.

Q3. If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any other disease.

ANS:

A bad quality of data or missing data can prove to be a problem for such models but if it works well for COVID-19, we might use a similar approach for other diseases in the future. It's like having a valuable tool for our medical facilities.
